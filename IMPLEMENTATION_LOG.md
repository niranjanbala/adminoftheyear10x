### Challenges Encountered and Solutions

#### Challenge 1: Directory Conflicts
**Problem:** `create-next-app` couldn't initialize in existing directory with spec files  
**Solution:** Manually created Next.js project structure to preserve existing `.kiro/` specs  
**Decision:** This approach maintains our spec-driven development workflow

#### Challenge 2: Jest Configuration Issues
**Problem:** Module path aliases not working in Jest, Supabase mocking issues  
**Solution:** 
- Simplified Jest config to use Next.js defaults
- Removed problematic global mocks
- Used relative imports in tests temporarily
**Decision:** Focus on getting basic setup working, will improve Jest config in later tasks

#### Challenge 3: Missing Dependencies
**Problem:** `tailwindcss-animate` not included in initial package.json  
**Solution:** Added missing dependency and verified build  
**Decision:** Always verify build after dependency changes

#### Challenge 4: Next.js 15 Metadata Warnings
**Problem:** Deprecated metadata properties in Next.js 15  
**Solution:** Moved `themeColor` and `viewport` to separate viewport export  
**Decision:** Follow Next.js 15 best practices for metadata handling

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **Next.js 15 with App Router:** Using latest stable version for best performance and features
2. **Supabase for Backend:** Aligns with design document, provides real-time capabilities
3. **ShadCN/UI Components:** Modern, accessible component library with Tailwind integration
4. **TypeScript Strict Mode:** Ensures type safety throughout the application
5. **PWA-First Approach:** Configured from the start for mobile-first experience
6. **Test Coverage at 70%:** Balanced between quality and development speed

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **HubSpot OAuth 2.0:** Primary authentication method for HubSpot account verification
2. **Supabase Auth Integration:** Hybrid approach using HubSpot for verification and Supabase for session management
3. **Role-Based Access Control:** Hierarchical permission system (participant < voter < organizer < super_admin)
4. **JWT Token Management:** Secure token storage and automatic refresh
5. **Client-Side State Management:** React Context for global authentication state
6. **Middleware Pattern:** Composable middleware for API route protection

### Authentication Flow

#### 1. Login Process
```
User clicks "Sign in with HubSpot" 
→ Redirect to HubSpot OAuth 
→ User authorizes application 
→ Callback with authorization code 
→ Exchange code for tokens 
→ Verify HubSpot account 
→ Create/update user in database 
→ Create Supabase session 
→ Redirect to dashboard
```

#### 2. Permission System
```typescript
// Role hierarchy (higher number = more permissions)
participant: 0    // Can participate in competitions
voter: 1         // Can vote (verified HubSpot users)
organizer: 2     // Can create and manage competitions
super_admin: 3   // Full platform access
```

#### 3. Security Features
- **OAuth Verification:** Only verified HubSpot accounts can access
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents spam and abuse
- **CSRF Protection:** Secure API endpoints
- **JWT Tokens:** Secure session management
- **Role-Based Access:** Granular permission control

### Challenges Encountered and Solutions

#### Challenge 1: Next.js 15 Compatibility
**Problem:** NextRequest doesn't have `ip` property in Next.js 15  
**Solution:** Used headers (`x-forwarded-for`, `x-real-ip`) for IP detection  
**Decision:** More reliable IP detection for production environments

#### Challenge 2: Build-Time Environment Variables
**Problem:** Supabase client initialization failing during build  
**Solution:** Added fallback values and client-side initialization checks  
**Decision:** Graceful degradation for build-time compatibility

#### Challenge 3: useSearchParams Suspense Requirement
**Problem:** Next.js 15 requires Suspense boundary for useSearchParams  
**Solution:** Wrapped component in Suspense with loading fallback  
**Decision:** Better user experience with proper loading states

#### Challenge 4: TypeScript Middleware Composition
**Problem:** Complex type inference with composed middleware functions  
**Solution:** Simplified function signatures and explicit typing  
**Decision:** Maintainable code over complex type gymnastics

**Solution:** Simplified handler signatures and extracted route params from URL  
**Decision:** More flexible approach that works with middleware composition

#### Challenge 3: Type Safety with Database Operations
**Problem:** TypeScript type mismatches between API responses and component interfaces  
**Solution:** Added type casting and interface alignment  
**Decision:** Maintain type safety while allowing for API flexibility

#### Challenge 4: Client-Server Component Separation
**Problem:** Server-only imports being used in client components  
**Solution:** Moved server-side logic to API routes and used client-side alternatives  
**Decision:** Clear separation of concerns between client and server code

### Security Implementation

1. **Role-Based Access Control:**
   - Only organizers and super admins can create competitions
   - Competition creators can edit their own competitions
   - Super admins have full access to all competitions

2. **Input Validation:**
   - Client-side validation with Zod schemas
   - Server-side validation on all API endpoints
   - Date sequence validation for competition timeline
   - Participant limit validation

3. **Data Protection:**
   - User authentication required for competition creation
   - Protected API routes with middleware
   - Proper error handling without information leakage

### User Experience Features

1. **Intuitive Interface:**
   - Clear visual hierarchy and competition status indicators
   - Responsive design for all device sizes
   - Loading states and error feedback
   - Empty state handling with helpful messages

2. **Rich Competition Display:**
   - Tabbed interface for organized information
   - Real-time status updates and phase detection
   - Participant galleries with profile integration
   - Interactive leaderboards with rankings

3. **Smart Filtering and Search:**
   - Text-based search across titles and descriptions
   - Tier-based filtering (local, national, global)
   - Status-based filtering (registration open, voting open, etc.)
   - Real-time filter application

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Efficient Data Loading:** API-based data fetching with proper caching
2. **Component Optimization:** Lazy loading and efficient re-renders
3. **Search Performance:** Client-side filtering for instant results
4. **Image Handling:** Proper image optimization warnings for future enhancement

### Integration Points

- **Authentication:** Seamless integration with auth system for role-based features
- **Database:** Direct integration with competition and participation services
- **Profile System:** Integration with user profiles for participant display
- **Real-time:** Foundation for real-time updates and notifications

### Verification Tests Passed

1. ✅ Build completes successfully with all components
2. ✅ TypeScript compilation passes with proper type safety
3. ✅ Competition creation form validates correctly
4. ✅ API endpoints handle requests and responses properly
5. ✅ Competition listing and filtering works as expected
6. ✅ Competition detail pages display all information correctly
7. ✅ Role-based access control functions properly

### Next Steps

Task 5 is complete and the competition management system is fully functional. Ready to proceed to Task 6 (Participant Registration and Approval System). The competition system provides:

- ✅ Complete competition lifecycle management
- ✅ Multi-tier competition support (local → national → global)
- ✅ Role-based competition creation and management
- ✅ Real-time status detection and phase management
- ✅ Comprehensive search and filtering capabilities
- ✅ Rich competition detail views with participant information
- ✅ Secure API endpoints with proper validation
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design with excellent UX

**Ready to proceed to Task 6: Participant Registration and Approval System**
