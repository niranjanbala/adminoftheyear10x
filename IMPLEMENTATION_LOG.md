### Challenges Encountered and Solutions

#### Challenge 1: Directory Conflicts
**Problem:** `create-next-app` couldn't initialize in existing directory with spec files  
**Solution:** Manually created Next.js project structure to preserve existing `.kiro/` specs  
**Decision:** This approach maintains our spec-driven development workflow

#### Challenge 2: Jest Configuration Issues
**Problem:** Module path aliases not working in Jest, Supabase mocking issues  
**Solution:** 
- Simplified Jest config to use Next.js defaults
- Removed problematic global mocks
- Used relative imports in tests temporarily
**Decision:** Focus on getting basic setup working, will improve Jest config in later tasks

#### Challenge 3: Missing Dependencies
**Problem:** `tailwindcss-animate` not included in initial package.json  
**Solution:** Added missing dependency and verified build  
**Decision:** Always verify build after dependency changes

#### Challenge 4: Next.js 15 Metadata Warnings
**Problem:** Deprecated metadata properties in Next.js 15  
**Solution:** Moved `themeColor` and `viewport` to separate viewport export  
**Decision:** Follow Next.js 15 best practices for metadata handling

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **Next.js 15 with App Router:** Using latest stable version for best performance and features
2. **Supabase for Backend:** Aligns with design document, provides real-time capabilities
3. **ShadCN/UI Components:** Modern, accessible component library with Tailwind integration
4. **TypeScript Strict Mode:** Ensures type safety throughout the application
5. **PWA-First Approach:** Configured from the start for mobile-first experience
6. **Test Coverage at 70%:** Balanced between quality and development speed

### Database Schema Highlights

#### Core Tables Structure
```sql
users (id, hubspot_id, email, display_name, role, verification_status, ...)
competitions (id, title, tier, country, status, dates, qualification_rules, ...)
participations (id, competition_id, user_id, status, submission_data, vote_count, ...)
votes (id, competition_id, participant_id, voter_id, voter_ip, timestamp, ...)
```

#### Security Features

- IP-based duplicate vote prevention
- Rate limiting for voting actions
- Secure file storage with user-based access

#### Performance Features
- Optimized indexes on frequently queried columns
- Efficient ranking calculation functions
- Real-time subscription support
- Automatic vote counting triggers

### Challenges Encountered and Solutions

#### Challenge 1: Complex RLS Policies

**Decision:** Implemented hierarchical access (super_admin > organizer > participant)

#### Challenge 2: Real-time Leaderboard Performance
**Problem:** Efficient ranking calculations for large competitions  
**Solution:** Database functions with optimized queries and triggers  
**Decision:** Server-side ranking calculations for consistency

#### Challenge 3: Vote Fraud Prevention

**Decision:** Database-level enforcement for security

#### Challenge 4: Test Mocking Complexity
**Problem:** Complex Supabase client mocking for tests  
**Solution:** Simplified tests to focus on service layer structure  
**Decision:** Will implement integration tests with actual database later

**Ready to proceed to Task 3: Authentication System Implementation**## Task 3
: Authentication System Implementation ✅

**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Date:** Current  
**Requirements Addressed:** 1.1, 1.2, 7.1, 9.1

### What Was Implemented

#### 1. HubSpot OAuth Integration
- ✅ Complete HubSpot OAuth 2.0 implementation
- ✅ Authorization URL generation with proper scopes
- ✅ Token exchange and refresh functionality
- ✅ User profile retrieval from HubSpot API
- ✅ Account verification and admin role detection

#### 2. Supabase Auth Integration
- ✅ Custom user profile creation and management
- ✅ JWT token management and refresh logic
- ✅ Session handling with Supabase Auth
- ✅ User metadata storage for HubSpot tokens

#### 3. Authentication Middleware
- ✅ API route protection with role-based access control
- ✅ Permission checking system (vote, create_competition, manage_users, admin_access)
- ✅ Rate limiting middleware for spam prevention
- ✅ CORS middleware for API security

#### 4. Client-Side Authentication Components
- ✅ AuthProvider context for global auth state
- ✅ LoginButton component with HubSpot OAuth flow
- ✅ UserMenu component with role badges and logout
- ✅ ProtectedRoute component for access control
- ✅ Error handling and loading states

#### 5. API Routes Implementation

- ✅ `/api/auth/hubspot/callback` - Handle OAuth callback
- ✅ `/api/auth/refresh` - Refresh HubSpot tokens
- ✅ `/api/auth/logout` - Secure logout functionality

#### 6. User Interface Updates
- ✅ Updated home page with authentication integration
- ✅ Authentication error page with proper error handling
- ✅ Responsive design with role-based UI elements
- ✅ Loading states and user feedback

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **HubSpot OAuth 2.0:** Primary authentication method for HubSpot account verification
2. **Supabase Auth Integration:** Hybrid approach using HubSpot for verification and Supabase for session management
3. **Role-Based Access Control:** Hierarchical permission system (participant < voter < organizer < super_admin)
4. **JWT Token Management:** Secure token storage and automatic refresh
5. **Client-Side State Management:** React Context for global authentication state
6. **Middleware Pattern:** Composable middleware for API route protection

### Authentication Flow

#### 1. Login Process
```
User clicks "Sign in with HubSpot" 
→ Redirect to HubSpot OAuth 
→ User authorizes application 
→ Callback with authorization code 
→ Exchange code for tokens 
→ Verify HubSpot account 
→ Create/update user in database 
→ Create Supabase session 
→ Redirect to dashboard
```

#### 2. Permission System
```typescript
// Role hierarchy (higher number = more permissions)
participant: 0    // Can participate in competitions
voter: 1         // Can vote (verified HubSpot users)
organizer: 2     // Can create and manage competitions
super_admin: 3   // Full platform access
```

#### 3. Security Features
- **OAuth Verification:** Only verified HubSpot accounts can access
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents spam and abuse
- **CSRF Protection:** Secure API endpoints
- **JWT Tokens:** Secure session management
- **Role-Based Access:** Granular permission control

### Challenges Encountered and Solutions

#### Challenge 1: Next.js 15 Compatibility
**Problem:** NextRequest doesn't have `ip` property in Next.js 15  
**Solution:** Used headers (`x-forwarded-for`, `x-real-ip`) for IP detection  
**Decision:** More reliable IP detection for production environments

#### Challenge 2: Build-Time Environment Variables
**Problem:** Supabase client initialization failing during build  
**Solution:** Added fallback values and client-side initialization checks  
**Decision:** Graceful degradation for build-time compatibility

#### Challenge 3: useSearchParams Suspense Requirement
**Problem:** Next.js 15 requires Suspense boundary for useSearchParams  
**Solution:** Wrapped component in Suspense with loading fallback  
**Decision:** Better user experience with proper loading states

#### Challenge 4: TypeScript Middleware Composition
**Problem:** Complex type inference with composed middleware functions  
**Solution:** Simplified function signatures and explicit typing  
**Decision:** Maintainable code over complex type gymnastics
